Assembly level Language:

1.Fibonaaci Sequence : A Fibonacci sequence is defined as a set of numbers such that each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers, starting from 0 and 1.

%The following code is written in JavaScript, a high-level language. It implements an algorithm by using constructs such as variables, for-loops, and other statements.

let number = 10
let n1 = 0, n2 = 1, nextTerm;

for (let i = 1; i <= number; i++) {
    console.log(n1);
    nextTerm = n1 + n2;
    n1 = n2;
    n2 = nextTerm;
}

The preceding code illustrates an algorithm for implementing a Fibonacci sequence. Now, here's the corresponding code in the assembly language:
